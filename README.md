### Your job is to make sure that every egg (E) has a chicken (C) right next to it.
### You start in the white space, and you can only move to an adjacent cell in the Up, Down, Left or Right direction. When you move, all chickens in the new square you moved to will run away from you to the last cell you were in.
### And that's it!
### In the above example, the solution would be [Left, Up, Right, Right] to guarantee all the eggs are covered.
